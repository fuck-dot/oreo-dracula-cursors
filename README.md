# oreo-dracula-cursors
i compiled this cursor for you senpaiiii~ ðŸ˜³

this is a version of the (really pretty) [oreo cursors](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/oreo-cursors#generate-user-defined-colours-and-sizes-) modified to fit the [dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) color theme, including a few versions inspired by queer pride flags (they're not very good though)

we got trans pride with a white shadow, trans pride with a black shadow, we got nb pride, we have ace pride, lesbians, bisexuals, pansexuals hell yeah


# installation for every user
basically u just copy the cursors you want to /usr/share/icons/

```git clone https://github.com/fuck-dot/oreo-dracula-cursors.git
sudo cp -r oreo-dracula-cursors/cursors/* /usr/share/icons/ 
```
then you can optionally remove the oreo-dracula-cursors folder because you don't rlly need it anymore
```rm -r oreo-dracula-cursors```


# installation only for u UwU
same deal as above but you copy them to ~/.icons/

```git clone https://github.com/fuck-dot/oreo-dracula-cursors.git
cp -r oreo-dracula-cursors/cursors/* ~/.icons/
```
then you can optionally remove the oreo-dracula-cursors folder because you don't rlly need it anymore
```rm -r oreo-dracula-cursors```


# compile the cursors yourself or costumize something
follow the instructions on [the oreo cursors github] (https://github.com/Souravgoswami/oreo-cursors#generate-user-defined-colours-and-sizes-), except use the colours.config file this repo instead of theirs (because it is much better and cooler thankyouverymuch)
